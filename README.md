This is the README for our Friday Project 6

FP6grid.py is a file that pulls up a GUI that shows a simple sign up page consisting of Name, Email, and Password with a login button. The grid() function was
used to position the boxes/buttons.

FP6pack.py is a file that pulls up an interface for a simple calculator that does not accept input. It has buttons for all 9 numbers and 4 operators with an entry box at
the top that is used to represent the input/output. The pack() function was used to position the boxes/buttons.

FP6place.py is a file that pulls up a simple login page with Username and Password where text is allowed to be put into the entry boxes and a login button. 
The place() function was used to position the boxes/buttons.
